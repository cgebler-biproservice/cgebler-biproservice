## 🚀 About Me

I'm a **Solution Architect** with a knack for designing systems that just *work*. Whether it’s building scalable architectures, solving complex puzzles, or making tech *actually understandable* to humans, I’m your go-to person.  

When I’m not architecting the next big thing, you can find me:
- 🌌 Thinking about the future of technology.
- ☕ Overanalyzing my coffee brewing setup.
- 📚 Reading chess books that I promise I’ll finish (eventually).
